            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Let us con≈øider who keeps the precept be≈øt; He that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, or he that con≈øiders not but when he ≈øpeakes: What man in the world is ha≈øty <hi>to offer any thing before God,</hi> if he bee not who prayes <hi>ex tempore?</hi> And then adde to it but the weight of <hi>Solomons</hi> rea≈øon, and let any man an≈øwer me if he thinks it can well ≈øtand with that reverence we owe to the Immen≈øe, the infinite, and to the eternall God, the God of wi≈ødome, to offer him a ≈øacrifice which we dur≈øt not pre≈øent to a Prince, or a prudent Governour in <hi>re ≈øeri√¢,</hi> ≈øuch as our prayers ought to be.</p>

That which we call our be≈øt, and is truly ≈øo in humane e≈øtimate, that plea≈øes God, for it declares that if we had better, we would give it him. But to re≈øerve the be≈øt, ≈øayes too plainly, that we think any thing is good enough for him.

It is well if it be. But there is ≈øecurity given us by the Directory; for the matter is left at every mans di≈øpo≈øe for all that, and we mu≈øt depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hone≈øty of every particular for it; and if any man proves a Heretick, or a Knave, then he may introduce what impiety he plea≈øe, into the publick formes of Gods wor≈øhip; and there is no law made to prevent it, and it mu≈øt be cured afterwards if it can; but before-hand it is not prevented at all by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, which tru≈øts every man. But I ob≈øerve, that all the benefit which is pretended, is, that it will make an able Mini≈øtery, which I confe≈ø≈øe I am very much from believing, and ≈øo will every man be that con≈øiders what kind of men they are that have been mo≈øt zealous for that way of conceived prayer. I am ≈øure that very few of the learned≈øt, very many ignorants, mo≈øt tho≈øe who have made lea≈øt abode in the Schools of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. And that I may di≈øgrace no mans per≈øon, we ≈øee Trade≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the mo≈øt illiberall arts, and women pretend to it, and doe it with as many words (and that's the maine thing) with as much confidence, and ≈øpeciou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øpirit, as the be≈øt among them. And it is but a ≈ømall portion of learning that will ≈øerve a man to make conceived formes of prayer, which they have ea≈øily upon the ≈øtock of other men, or upon their own fancie, or upon any thing in which no learning is required. He that knowes nothing of the craft may be in the Preachers trade. But what? Is God better ≈øerved? I would faine ≈øee any Authority, or any rea≈øon, or any probability for that. I am ≈øure ignorant men offer him none of the be≈øt ≈øacrifices <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and learned men will be ≈øure to deliberate, and know. God is then better ≈øerved, when he ≈øerved by a publike, then when by a private ≈øpirit. I cannot imagine what accruements will hence come to the publike: it may be ≈øome advantages may be to the private intere≈øts of men. For there are a ≈øort of men whom out ble≈ø≈øed Saviour noted, who do <hi>devoure widowes hou≈øes, and for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115793:16"/>although the Common-prayer Book in the Preface to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory bee charged with unnece≈ø≈øary length, yet we ≈øee that mo≈øt of the≈øe men, they that are mo≈øt eminent or would be ≈øo, make their prayers longer, and will not lo≈øe the benefits which their credit gets, and they by their credit, for making their prayers.</p>
            <p>Adde to this that there is no promi≈øe in Scripture, that he who prayes <hi>ex tempore</hi> ≈øhall be heard the better, or that he ≈øhall bee a≈ø≈øi≈øted at all to ≈øuch purpo≈øes; and therefore to innovate in ≈øo high a matter without a warrant to command us, or a promi≈øe to warrant us, is no better then vanity in the thing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption in the per≈øon. He therefore that con≈øiders that this way of prayer is without all manner of precedent in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, again≈øt the example of all famous Churches in all Chri≈øtendome in the whole de≈øcent of 15. Ages, without all command and warrant of Scripture, that it is unrea≈øonable in the nature of the thing, again≈øt prudence and the be≈øt wi≈øedome of humanity, becau≈øe it is without deliberation, that it is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in a high degree without that Authority which is truly and by inherent and ancient right to command and pre≈øcribe to us in externall forms of wor≈øhip, that it is much to the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the fir≈øt reformers of our Religion, that it gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Papi≈øts, to quarrell with ≈øome rea≈øon and more pretence again≈øt our Reformation, as being by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory confe≈ø≈øed to have been done in much blindne≈ø≈øe, and therefore might erre in the exce≈ø≈øe as well as in the defect, in the throwing out too much, as ca≈øting off too little, which is the more likely, becau≈øe they wanted zeale to carry it farre enough. He that confiders the univer≈øall deformity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like wor≈øhip, and the no meanes of union, no Symbol of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like communion being publikely con≈øigned, that all Here≈øies may with the ≈øame Authority bee brought into our prayers, and offered to God in behalfe of the people, with the ≈øame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that any truth may, all the matter of our prayers being left to the choyce of all men, of all per≈øwa≈øions, and then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerves that actually there are in many places, here≈øie, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øphemy, and impertinency, and illiterate rudene≈ø≈øes put into the devotions of the mo≈øt Solemne dayes, and the mo≈øt publike
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115793:17"/>meetings; and then la≈øtly, that there are divers parts of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, for which no provi≈øions at all is made in the Directory, and the very admini≈øtration of the Sacraments left ≈øo loo≈øely, that if there be any thing e≈ø≈øentiall in the forms of Sacraments, the Sacrament may come ineffectuall by want of due words, and due mini≈øtration. I ≈øay, he that con≈øiders all the≈øe things (and many more he may con≈øider) will finde that particular men are not fit to be intru≈øted to offer in publike with their private ≈øpirit, to God, for the people, in ≈øuch ≈øolemnities, in matters of ≈øo great concernment, where the honour of God, the benefit of the people, the intere≈øt of Kingdomes, the being of a Church, the unity of minds, the conformity of practice, the truth of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øions, and the ≈øalvation of ≈øoules, are ≈øo very much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as they are in the publike prayers of a whole Nationall Church. An unlearned man is not to be tru≈øted, and a wi≈øe man dare not tru≈øt him≈øelfe; hee that is ignorant cannot, he that is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not.</p>
